I later watched an interview with a young woman barber in Indonesia, where most Muslims are highly tolerant of other faiths (five are officially recognized by the government) and virtually all Muslim women wear the local style of hijab. When she was asked how she reconciled her profession with Muslim restrictions on contact with men, she replied in a matter of fact way that if she followed this rule she wouldn't be able to work and support her small daughter, and that wouldn't be good for anyone.

This applies even when they can stay home or want to stay home. Secondly, the responsibility of child care and education belongs to the government, with parents assisting only. I would hate to see a society where all of our decisions belong to the government and parents and families have only a secondary role.

The one-country/one-vote system means that it becomes all too easy to corrupt the voting system by offering inducements/bribes to representatives of poor countries.

My preference (hardly ideal, but practical) would be to have a rotation of World Cup venues: Europe, Asia, Africa, the Americas, Middle East. This would not eradicate corruption, but might well limit its scope. And, btw, it would be a very good idea to have term limits on elected FIFA executives.

    "text": "In the early 90's I was studying Maths of Finance at university and fees and charges were just starting to raise their ugly heads. In hindsight Australia is about 20 years ahead of the US with regards to bank fees and charges and now the amount spent on User Paid fees and charges each year is equivalent to the total amount of profits declared by the Australian banks each year. I was curious and developed the Leveraged Depreciated User Paid Leasing system model at the time to calculate the consolidated impact of levying fees and charges per $1 unit on items that were already depreciable and leasable such as ATMs and PC's. It's not surprising that this simple but userous structure (with a 10%GST) can produce $1.36 in tax for the government and $2.56 in direct profits for the banks while the poor old user has to pay $6 for something that previously only cost the bank $1 in house and the government $1 from the public purse in depreciation, leaving the user and the bank with no net impost.",

Portugal decriminalized all drugs and their addiction rates have gone way down. The only 'gateway effect' of marijuana is because dealers are criminals with access to other criminal enterprises. Change the law and put unaccountable criminals out of business. To conflate childhood exposure with decriminalization is backward.

Because it's not the right way to treat people. All of the evidence presented in this debate is valid. Particularly that on the costs of our health and its burden on others. I do not believe that there is one obese person that would choose to remain obese if a miracle drug could return them to a normal weight. Obesity is a physical and an emotional nightmare. It eats at you (no pun intended) every hour of the day. We have irrefutable proof that it's thoroughly toxic, in every sense of the word. And yes, we should, as a people, be nutritionally sophisticated. Yet, we're not - we're nowhere near. But, by adopting many of these reforms and legislating stiff penalties, we are just going too far. Have we sunk so low that we are now to make laws and develop policies against the physique of our neighbor? The very thought is insane. There are better ways to solve this problem.",

By calling on a boycott to Israel, you will lose a lot of medical and technological advances that they are creating. Of course, she probably doesn't care about other countries that show much more signs of oppression to minority groups be it the Kurds, Tibetan Monks, or any others. However, there are no calls to boycott those countries, which is more proof of anti-semitism. I wonder what she thinks about Syria killing a lot more civilians on a higher scale or even Russia for what's going on Ukraine. My answer is probably nothing. Also, many of what happens to the Gaza Strip is because Hamas has a long history of placing their own kind into harm's way while they are hiding in safe shelters and tunnels that their people aren't allowed to use.

Oxycodone on the black market was going for 20 to 60 dollars depending on strength. This lead the cash strapped youth to seek out methods such as smoking it to make it go further. Eventually they figure out smoking oxycodone and smoking heroin are identical and heroin is a lot cheaper. From there they may go on to shooting it up assuming they survive the smoking stage.

For those at the bottom of our society, it does seem that the competition for jobs might be one of the many factors keeping wages low. But I think that we could work on that with a combination of training, apprenticeships, higher minimum wages and insourcing of manufacturing back from overseas. Combined these would cost much less than a wall on our southern border and rounding up millions of undocumented immigrants. Less disruptive also.",

The difference would not be detectable unless one has prior knowledge of some kind. So engineering is a cause of mutation as well as human intervention. The purpose of patents is to provide a monopoly in the market for the innovators in order to encourage innovations. But extended monopolies tend to discourage further innovations, so the length of patents must be limited. The patenting of naturally occurring gene sequences has resulted in the legal requirement of anyone treating conditions related to those sequences patented be approved by and compensation provided to the patent holders. It's a perverse use of patents that actually inhibits innovations and blocks medical care for seriously ill patients. It's morally and ethically degenerate and it violates the principle that knowledge about nature is not subject to patents or copyrights. The subject of engineered genes should probably handled like horticultural products.",

This turned out not to be possible because none of the certified nurse midwives in town were willing to attend a home birth, and I wanted a midwife with at least that level of training. Instead, I went to the hospital, where my husband functioned very effectively as my midwife for 4 of my 5 hours of labor. The midwife appeared within an hour of the birth and was busy gathering supplies when the baby was born, so I caught him myself. After filling out paperwork, the midwife left and I literally never heard from her again. No MD was ever involved. For this birth, the charge was over $3,000. Welcome to America.",

The only way to stanch that flow of resources is to at least supply the most acceptable opposition forces and to marginalize the more dangerous opposition actors. What all this means is that intervention is inevitable and that the cost and complexity of intervention only increases with time.
