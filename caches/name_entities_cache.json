The posts which complain about keeping up bikes lanes are absurd. It is so much more expensive to maintain automobile roads than those for cycle culture. Believe me, when the 5-6 dollar a gallon gas gets here, you will ride. And believe me, a couple of weeks of commuting or shopping with your bike will make you a believer!

Teachers should serve the schools boards, and the parents associations, not themselves. The fact that an outspoken teacher may be fired could be a good thing. In higher education, where research is done, tenure certainly has a place. However, to get tenure, takes an awe inspiring mix of academic credentials, politics, and dedication. And it happens without a union. In secondary education, it takes virtually nothing as the teachers union strangles local governments.

I don't think, as others have confirmed, that being a Judge precludes one from abdicating one's right to vote and free speech on the candidates that stand for election.

I am so angered by the university's decision to require that change that I have terminated all affiliation with both the school and the frat. When last I checked, fraternities were a form of voluntary association. No one was required to join one. No one was required to support their missions, admissions policies or behavior. No one was required to attend their parties. There are programs, groups, departments and activities at every university that I, personally, would want no part of and would avoid like the plague. Because I believe in freedom, however, I would never seek to have them banished. Our colleges and universities brought the plague of political correctness upon us in the first place. The war on frats, because of what it represents, is a new and very dangerous acceleration in the trend to take away our freedoms and replace them with approved group norms.

Unfortunately, the intellectual challenges presented to research workers in most of these areas are rather minimal. Often current applied research is based on well-understood topics in pure physics and mathematics. It's dull research for minimally-trained scientists. The main benefit to such applied fields is that the intellectual distance between the faculty and the students is narrowing. The other benefit is in grants, contracts, and patents that the military-industrial-pharmaceutical complex makes possible. Thus the faculty now trains little cogs for the benefit of the Empire. The loss of French departments and other humanities departments is just part of the reorganized modern university, which is an instrument of the modern nation state to attain greater wealth and power for some and a stultifying life for most.

These geology maors, who were preparing themselves with the scientific understanding to deal with mineral managements, were also intellectually engaged in a most vivid way with their classics and philosophy classes.

  "As a society we believe that all men are created equal and endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights including life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness which means that parents may not deprive their children of these rights anymore than can the state. Legally, it's not so clear because our Constitution guarantees freedom of religion while our statutes and the common law set some limits upon how individuals can treat their children when the outcomes imperil their lives and welfare. As a result even if the parents opt out of health care insurance because they do not seek any health care, if they or their children need emergency care it will be provided unless they can legally refuse treatment -- meaning that the children will likely receive health care when the conditions are serious enough regardless of the parents wishes.": [

  "The author's opinion of public transit in Los Angeles and San Francisco / Oakland / San José is dated. Both metro areas have good public transit, and getting better. Even if LA's is not currently much used by upper middle class riders, these are not the only people we care about. Moreover, he is badly mistaken when he says that a high-speed rail service \"doesn't touch the huge mass of traffic, which swirls daily in the Los Angeles and San Francisco metropolitan areas.\" Intercity rail and local transit are mutually supportive. Predictably, if high speed trains arrive in downtown LA, more people will use the red, gold and other rail lines to reach their trains than currently do to get to LAX. On the contrary, shifting intercity travel preferences has great potential, especially over time, to shift local travel preferences. Without knowing the author's work, I would further point out that Stanford's record on the study of high speed rail is weak, and that Stanford's professors have been numerous (if short-sighted) in protesting a high-speed rail service that they - probably mistakenly - see as negatively impacting their quality of life.

It simply tells you what question you need to ask next. Because what we want is not a high voter turnout. What we want is a large majority of Americans making their opinions heard. While voter turnout is an indicator of that, you don't cure a disease by covering up the symptoms. If educated people tend to vote more, then that should be the focus.

Certainly critical thinking skills can be obtained in the social and natural sciences (often to a greater degree than in languages) and ditto for the other general skills it supposedly provides (but not necessarily). The point is that Humanities constitutes windows to many areas of human thinking and accomplishment in the past and present--and that in itself is sufficient justification. The arguments put forth by Humanists in this piece are not very compelling (if that is a sign of the skills the discipline trains them for). Include some scientists in the debate to make it interdisciplinary. An important issue that has determined the desperate thinking of parents and students is that the cost of university education--even public education--has gone up enormously and the investment cost in education (for families and the state) makes them increasingly think in these narrowly pragmatic terms.

Demand start to slip, investment opportunities in the real economy dry up and the next thing you know you have Apple sitting on a mountain of cash because they have run out of consumers who can afford their products and they can make more money out of financial speculation than trying to create profitable products that are cheap enough for an impoverished proletariat. Continuously narrowing your consumer base and expecting long term stability is just plain dumb.

  "Perhaps rather than forcing greek societies - private organizations controlled individually by charters mandating single-sex admittance - to change their policies, perhaps universities could instead change rules that force fraternities to be the center of social life on campus. Allowing sororities to host parties, for instance, would put women in charge of the distribution of alcohol, which in turn could help to curtail instances of alcohol-related sexual assault. Campuses forcing greek life to go co-ed will lead only to the national chapters of these organizations to suspend their charters at the school. These organizations will, and in my experience have, continue to operate as an underground organization, rather than actually disband; this would only exacerbate the problem, as a secret frat or sorority can be controlled even less than one that operates in the light of day.": [

Tenure can be adjusted to require some greater experience and qualifications but eliminating it just makes teaching a far less desirable occupation.

There are better teachers in such communities because they are supported much better in those communities.

Economic growth requires innovation, enabled through this kind of technologies. Innovation is an integral part of prosperity of an organization which cannot occur without embracing state of the art capabilities. One important capability of 3D printing, is to enable continuous innovations. Yet, as aptly pointed out by the author, traditional manufacturing still holds an important place in the business world. Once products are developed, it is challenging for 3D printers to match the economies of scale available through traditional manufacturing. The main advantage of 3D printing is enabling of low cost rapid prototypes , as compared to traditional manufacturing, which typically requires higher volumes to lower costs. 3D printing will potentially have a greater impact on the world over the next 20 years than all of the innovations from the industrial revolution combined.

The two articles I refer to are: \"Apartheid in the Curriculum.\" Harvard Magazine, January-February 1992, p. 14. \"A Crit of Lit: Teaching Literature in the Ivory Tower.\" Perspective, vol. X, no. 3 (April 1993), 8 ff. Reprinted vol. X, no. 5 (summer 1993), 20 ff.": [

  "Making sense does not mean making cents. It makes sense to build sewers, roads, and bridges. But the private sector does not undertake these infrastructure projects because it doesn't make cents (even though these infrastructure projects were an essential foundation upon which private enterprise made its cents). The good sense of the public has funded these infrastructure projects through taxes, for cents on the dollar and for the benefit of the public and private enterprise.

There are others who end up killing themselves. During prohibition, well meaning people attempted to protect everyone from alcohol. It was a disaster. If we coerce drug treatment, where do we stop.

  "Conservative Christians and evangelicals have not historically condemned divorce the way that the Bible does, but they certainly have condemned homosexuality, the way the Bible doesn't. I might respect conservative Christians for their consistency if they refused to do business with divorced people, the way they want to refuse gay patrons. But conservative Christians -- like Wheaton College -- employ divorced people, serve divorced people, and welcome divorced people into communion without blinking. Their constant refrain is that they \"hate the sin, but love the sinner.\" Now I'm not proposing we abolish divorce, but I do wish evangelicals would just NOTICE that sin, if they're so determined to purify our society. But, in fact, they treat divorced people very differently from gay people, and they're not even aware of their hypocrisy. If they could accept gay congregants the way they accept divorced congregants, the world would notice that the evangelical church is no longer self-righteous and judgemental and, frankly, angry.

Healthcare costs will continue to rise until a \"pay for quality and results\" model gets fully implemented. Without that these vouchers will never be allowed to grow in value equal to the healthcare inflation rate. So they will become less valuable and the poor and seniors will suffer.

  "'You must vote,\" I often hear, \"because the next president will pick who sits on the Supreme Court!\" That such a statement should even be made tells us that something has gone seriously wrong with our democracy.' Correct -- there is something wrong. Among the wrongs is that many of the Constitution's provisions are general ones, thereby allowing multiple interpretations (e.g. \"living Constitution\", \"originalism\", \"texturalism\"; conservative, liberal). This leads to Supreme Court Justices commonly being picked politically on the basis of the category (or their perceived politics) to which they presumably belong. Justices are not \"umpires\", to use Robert's word, in the sense of baseball where rules are clear and broadly followed. Rather, they are \"umpires\" each of whom follows their own set of rules and who are picked to do so. It's worth considering that doing similarly in baseball would destroy the game.": [
